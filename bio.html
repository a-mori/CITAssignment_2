    My name is Alex Mori. I was born in            
    Vancouver, but was raised in
    Kamloops. I chose to go to BCIT mostly because of the quality of
    education that I would receive here. I only have a younger sister,
    who is only a year younger than I am. Currently, I have no computer
    experience except for some basic java. That concludes my short bio.</h4>
